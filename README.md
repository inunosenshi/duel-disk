# Battle City Duel Disk

Just to make sure everyone understands, this repository is for the CAD drawings needed to assemble a revamped Battle City Duel Disk.

There are a couple things that you need to keep in mind as you are designing this duel disk. After the preliminary mock up is made, we will have to build the innards.

The hub will have to contain one [Raspberry pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/?variant=raspberry-pi-4-model-b-4gb) or [another credit card sized computer](https://www.robotsthenextspeciesonearth.com/p/best-5-credit-card-sized-single-board.html) which will be extremely powerful, without generating too much heat. Be prepared to incorporate proper ventilation into your design. The hub will also need to have five buttons. Each of these buttons would be necessary to activate a face down card

A network of Raspberry Pi zero nodes will have to be within the duel disk plates. It's nose will all be wired together and connected to the Raspberry Pi itself.

Finally a set of at least 12 to 18 Raspberry cameras will be used to identify cards by their [card passcode](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Passcode). Cards that do not have a passcode will be identified by there [card number](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Card_Number).
